This, is a fake repo. 

Alright, so a lot of the conflicts could have been resolved by just simply using a git pull. 
The majority of conflicts that I have seen happen are when two teams are working on the same branch/file and there ends up being trouble when they go to push if the other has already beaten them to pushing. Another instance is when someone (like in the example here) just does not pull at all. Which is what I simulated with Max, I did not pull ever unless prompted by the terminal to do so.
Needless to say, I think that actually realizing that the first README.md never saved is the difference between some points and some problems as well.

Thanks to the four characters for being intriguing in their formation of the chaos. Granted, by this point a merge conflict is not as daunting as it was to the past me first encountering one.
